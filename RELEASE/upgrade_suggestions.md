# Upgrade Suggestions

## Current Environment Status
- **Expo SDK**: 53.0.22 ✅ Current
- **React Native**: 0.79.5 ✅ Compatible

## Future Upgrade Considerations

### When Expo SDK 54+ is Available
```bash
# Check for new SDK versions
npx expo install --check

# Upgrade to new SDK (when stable)
npx expo install --fix
```

**Benefits of upgrading:**
- Latest React Native features
- Performance improvements  
- Security patches
- New Expo modules

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Review Expo SDK changelog
2. Test in development environment
3. Update dependencies with `npx expo install --fix`
4. Test thoroughly on both platforms
5. Update build profiles if needed

### Package Upgrade Opportunities

#### Development Experience
- **ESLint**: Consider updating to latest rules
- **TypeScript**: Keep up with latest stable versions
- **Prettier**: Update formatting rules as needed

#### Runtime Improvements  
- **React**: Monitor for React 19 stable release
