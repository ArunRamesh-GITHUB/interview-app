# Android Audio Recording Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Expo Configuration (`app.json`)
- Added `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permission alongside existing `RECORD_AUDIO`
- Increased `versionCode` from 5 to 6 (required for new builds)

### 2. Added Audio Dependencies
- Installed `expo-av` for proper audio permission handling and configuration

### 3. Created Audio Permission Utilities (`utils/permissions.ts`)
- `ensureMicPermission()`: Handles runtime permission requests for both Android and iOS
- `setupAudioMode()`: Configures optimal audio settings for recording
- `initializeAudioPermissions()`: Combined initialization function
- Added proper error handling and user-friendly permission dialogs

### 4. Enhanced WebView Component (`app/index.tsx`)
- Implemented proper permission flow before loading the WebView
- Added loading state during permission setup
- Enhanced `onPermissionRequest` handler to properly grant media permissions
- Added error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Fallback option to continue without audio permissions

### 5. Fixed App Structure
- Converted `_layout.tsx` to proper Expo Router layout structure
- Moved WebView logic to `index.tsx` for better organization

### 6. Created Audio Permissions Hook (`hooks/useAudioPermissions.ts`)
- Reusable hook for managing audio permission state
- Provides loading states, error handling, and permission retry functionality

## How These Fixes Address the Original Issues

1. **Manifest Permissions**: Added `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` to complement `RECORD_AUDIO`
2. **Runtime Permissions**: Proper Android permission flow using both `PermissionsAndroid` and `expo-av`
3. **Audio Mode Configuration**: Set up proper audio modes to prevent conflicts
4. **WebView Permissions**: Enhanced permission bridging between WebView and native
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
6. **Permission Timing**: Permissions are requested before WebView loads, preventing race conditions

## Build and Test Instructions

### 1. Build New Version
```bash
cd mobile-shell
npm run build:android
```

### 2. Test Locally (Development Build)
```bash
npx expo start
```

### 3. Create Internal Test Build
```bash
npm run build:android:preview
```

### 4. Important Notes
- **Must uninstall** the old version before installing new build (Android requires clean install for permission changes)
- Test on a physical Android device (emulator may have different permission behavior)
- Ensure the device microphone is not being used by another app during testing
- Check device settings to confirm microphone permission is granted to your app

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App requests microphone permission on first launch
- [ ] Permission dialog shows proper app name and description
- [ ] App continues to work if permission is denied (with fallback)
- [ ] Audio recording works within the WebView after permission is granted
- [ ] App handles permission revocation gracefully
- [ ] No conflicts with other audio apps (calls, music players)

## Troubleshooting

If recording still fails:
1. Check device Settings > Apps > Your App > Permissions > Microphone
2. Restart the app after granting permissions
3. Ensure no other apps are using the microphone
4. Check Android version - older versions may have different permission behavior
5. Verify the WebView URL uses HTTPS (required for media permissions)
